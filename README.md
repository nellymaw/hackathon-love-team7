## Dev Tools
[Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) & [Firefox Developer Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools)


## **Development Lifecycle and Task Allocation** ##

- The Team is made up of all experience levels from those who have only just started the course, right up to Alumni.
  - Our first task was to figure out at which level everyone is and how much time each of us has.
- Our team is [Daniel Callaghan](https://github.com/xiaoniuniu89), [Christopher Carabine](https://github.com/ccarabine), [Rodolfo Frainer](https://github.com/nellymaw), [Monique](https://github.com/Seamse), [Amir Rastkhadiv](https://github.com/Amir-Rastkhadiv) and [Cian O'Connor](https://github.com/AlexNexton).
- Initailly, we split all the task between us according to experience and competence.
- As the team developed and became more confident, we were able to help one another depending on the task and time we had free.



## **Version Control** ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate forked repositories for each team member.

Each member synchronised their own GitHub repositories by adding an additional remote  named `upstream` linked to the team's main [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Seamse/hackathon-love-team7) by entering the following steps Git commands:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Seamse/hackathon-love-team7.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

The following describes a typical Team Member's forked repository branch structure. The word 'contributor' is a placeholder for the otherwise name of the person or persons working on a paticular branch:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.

    - **contributor-README** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.

   -  **contributor_backend** -this branch is used for creating and updating all backend activities.
    -  **contributor_hompage** - this branch is used for styling and working on the index.html page.
    -  **contributor_style** - this branch is used for styling each page across the site so that they all look the same.



    
     
​
The following workflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
​
​
#### **Gitpod Workspaces** ####
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
​
​
#### **Branches** ####
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **other files** under normal site development, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. To create a **new branch** for bug fixes, use the git command `git checkout -b <branch-name>` to **create and switch** to the new branch.
​
​
#### **Working within a branch** ####
6. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
7. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
8. If the changes are in a newly created branch, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push --set-upstream origin <branch-name>` command as there is currently no upstream branch in the remote repository.
9. For branches that have already been synchronized, the **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
​
​
#### **Merging branches in GitHub** ####
10. Opening the repository in Github, a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to its related **Development**, **Development - JavaScript** or **Bug Fixes** project.
11. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
12. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
​
​
#### **Update Gitpod with the latest GitHub commits** ####
13. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
14. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
15. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod using the `git checkout <branch-name>` command and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
16. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
17. **Repeat steps 3 - 17 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.
    
#### **Pull Requests** ####

18. To update the upstream remote repository, each Team Member creates a pull request from the their forked master branch (`origin/master`) to the upstream Team repository (`upstream/master`)
19. The pull request is reviewed and any merge conflicts are resolved before merging into the upstream master branch.
20. Team Members must then fetch the latest commits again to their forked repositories using the following Git commands:

```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

# Deployment

## GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](!!!CHANGE-THIS!!!)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](!!!CHANGE-THIS!!!) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

## Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](!!!CHANGE-THIS!!!)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

## Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](!!!CHANGE-THIS!!!)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
